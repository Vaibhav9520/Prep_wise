# VAPI Error Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The error `Couldn't Get Assistant. assistantId 5e92c715-d8ef-45ad-b686-4b94ccd1652e Does Not Exist` was occurring because:

1. The application was trying to use a VAPI workflow/assistant ID that doesn't exist
2. The ID was stored in `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_WORKFLOW_ID` environment variable
3. This ID was being used for the "generate" type interviews

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Agent Component (`components/Agent.tsx`)
- **Before**: Used `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_WORKFLOW_ID` for generate type
- **After**: Uses the `interviewGenerator` assistant configuration
- Added proper error handling with try-catch block
- Added user-friendly error message if VAPI call fails

### 2. Created Interview Generator Assistant (`constants/index.ts`)
- Added `interviewGenerator` constant with proper VAPI configuration
- Configured specifically for generating interview questions
- Uses same voice and transcriber settings as interviewer
- Custom system prompt for question generation workflow

### 3. Environment Variables (`.env.local`)
- **Removed**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_WORKFLOW_ID` (invalid ID)
- **Kept**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_WEB_TOKEN` (still needed for authentication)

### 4. Error Handling Improvements
- Added try-catch block in `handleCall` function
- Provides user feedback when VAPI calls fail
- Resets call status to INACTIVE on error

## How It Works Now

### Generate Type Interview
- Uses `interviewGenerator` assistant
- Helps users create customized interview questions
- Asks about role, experience level, and technologies
- Generates relevant technical and behavioral questions

### Interview Type
- Uses `interviewer` assistant (unchanged)
- Conducts actual interviews with pre-generated questions
- Provides structured interview experience

## Testing
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No ESLint warnings
- ✅ All routes working properly

The VAPI integration should now work correctly without the assistant ID error.
